## Introduction

The structural equation models are
$$
\begin{aligned}
  \by &= \bnu + \bLambda \bfeta + \bepsilon \\
  \bfeta &= \balpha + \bB \bfeta  + \bzeta \\
  \bepsilon &\sim \N(\bzero, \bTheta_{\bepsilon}) \\
  \bzeta &\sim \N(\bzero, \bPsi) \\
\end{aligned}
$${#eq-sem}

where $\bLambda$ is the factor loading matrix, $\bfeta$ is the latent variable vector, $\bepsilon$ is the measurement error vector, $\bnu$ is the intercept vector, $\balpha$ is the intercept vector for the latent variables, $\bB$ is the regression coefficient matrix for the latent variables, and $\bTheta_{\bepsilon}$ and $\bPsi$ are the covariance matrices of the measurement errors and latent variables, respectively.
The model defined by @eq-sem is very nice.
