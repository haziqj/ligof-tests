abstract: |
  Limited information approaches overcome sparsity issues and computational challenges in traditional goodness-of-fit tests. This paper describes the implementation of LIGOF tests for ordinal factor models that have been fitted using the `{lavaan}` package in R. The tests are computationally efficient and reliable, and adapted to suit whichever parameter estimation procedure was used to fit the model. The implementation is available as an R package called `{lavaan.ligof}`.
