\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
Limited information approaches overcome sparsity issues and
computational challenges in traditional goodness-of-fit tests. This
paper describes the implementation of LIGOF tests for ordinal factor
models that have been fitted using the \texttt{\{lavaan\}} package in R.
The tests are computationally efficient and reliable, and adapted to
suit whichever parameter estimation procedure was used to fit the model.
The implementation is available as an R package called
\texttt{\{lavaan.ligof\}}.

\subsection{Ordinal data}\label{ordinal-data}

Consider the case of analysing multivariate data
\(\mathbf y = (y_{1}, \ldots, y_{p})^\top\), where each item \(y_{i}\)
is an ordinal random variable with \(m_i\) categories, \(i=1,\dots,p\).
Let
\(\mathcal R = \{ \mathbf c = (c_1,\dots, c_p)^\top \mid c_i \in \{1,\dots, m_i\}\}\)
be the set of all possible response patterns, and let
\(R=\prod_{i} m_i\) be the cardinality of this set. The joint
probability of observing a response pattern
\(\mathbf c_r \in \mathcal R\) is given by
\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-each-joint-resp-prob}{
\pi_r = \Pr(\mathbf y = \mathbf c_r) = \Pr(y_1 = \mathbf c_{r1}, \ldots, y_p = \mathbf c_{rp}), \hspace{2em} r = 1, \ldots, R,
}\end{equation} with \(\sum_r \pi_R = 1\). Collect all response
probabilities into the vector
\(\boldsymbol \pi = (\pi_1, \ldots, \pi_R)^\top \in [0,1]^R\). An
example with \(p=3\), \(m_1=2\), and \(m_2=m_3=3\) is given below. In
total, there are \(R=2 \times 3 \times 3 = 18\) response patterns as
shown in Table~\ref{tbl-response-patterns}.

Later on we wish to use lower-order residuals to assess the fit of a
model to the data, which first requires a description of lower-order
moments and its connection to the joint response probabilities.
Marginally, each \(y_i\) can be viewed as a multinoulli random variable
with event probabilities \(\pi^{(i)}_k = \Pr(y_i = k)\),
\(k=1,\dots m_i\), that sum to one. Therefore, this univariate
distribution is characterised by its \((m_i-1)\) \emph{moments}
\(\pi^{(i)}_2,\dots,\pi^{(i)}_{m_i}\), with the first moment being
redundant due to the sum to unity constraint. All univariate moments can
be collected into the vector
\(\dot{\boldsymbol\pi}_1 = (\pi^{(i)}_k)^\top\) whose dimension is
\(S_1 = \sum_i (m_i-1)\). In a similar light, the bivariate distribution
of \((y_i, y_j)\) is characterised by its \((m_i-1)(m_j-1)\) \emph{joint
moments} \(\pi^{(ij)}_{k,l} = \Pr(y_i = k, y_j = l)\),
\(k=2,\dots,m_i\), \(l=2,\dots,m_j\). Also collect all bivariate moments
into the vector \(\dot{\boldsymbol\pi}_2 = (\pi^{(ij)}_{k,l})^\top\)
whose dimension is \(S_2 = \sum_{i<j} (m_i-1)(m_j-1)\). Finally, denote
by \(\boldsymbol\pi_2 = (\dot\bpi_1^\top, \dot\bpi_2^\top)^\top\) the
vector of multivariate moments up to order 2, which is a vector of
length \(S = S_1 + S_2\).

Because the lower order moments are contained in the higher order
moments, the vector \(\boldsymbol\pi_2\) can be extracted from the joint
probabilities \(\bpi\) via a linear operation \(\bpi_2 = \bT_2 \bpi\)
(Jamil et al., 2025). As an example, continuing from the \(p=3\)
instance above, the moments for the first variable \(y_1\),
\(\Pr(y_1=2)\) can be obtained by \emph{summing} over all joint
probabilities whose patterns contain \(y_1=2\). The positions of these
joint probabilities in the vector \(\bpi\) are picked up by the first
row of the matrix \(\bT_2\). Similarly, the two bivariate moments of
\((y_1,y_2)\), i.e.~\(\pi^{(12)}_{22}\) and \(\pi^{(12)}_{23}\) are
obtained by summing over the joint probabilities whose patterns contain
\(y_1=2\) and \(y_2=2\), and \(y_1=2\) and \(y_2=3\), respectively.

Note that this construction of lower-order moments generalises to any
order \(q \le p\), but the total number of moments up to order \(q\)
grows combinatorially in both \(p\) and the category counts \(m_i\),
yielding design matrices \(\mathbf{T}_q\) that can become
computationally burdensome. Moreover, although we arbitrarily dropped
the first moment in the foregoing construction, the choice of which
category to omit is immaterial. This is because category probabilities
sum to one, so excluding any one category produces a similar-dimensional
parameterisation algebraically equivalent to excluding any other. For
further details, consult Reiser (1996) and Maydeu-Olivares \& Joe
(2006).

\subsection{Confirmatory factor
analysis}\label{confirmatory-factor-analysis}

The confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) model imposes a structure on the
joint response probabilities by assuming that the \(p\) observed
variables are manifestations of a smaller set of \(q\) latent variables.
In this way, the CFA may be viewed as a data-reduction technique since,
effectively, the correlations among variables are modelled by a
pre-specific factor structure using lower-dimensional data summaries.

CFA is typically used for continuous manifest variables, but it can also
be applied to ordinal data. A common approach is the \emph{underlying
variable} (UV) approach, where the observed responses \(y_i\) are
assumed to be discretised versions of continuous latent variables
\(y_i^*\). The connection is made through \[
y_i = \begin{cases}
1 & \ \ \tau_0^{(i)} < y^*_i < \tau_1^{(i)} \\
2 &  \ \ \tau_{1}^{(i)} <  y^*_i < \tau_2^{(i)} \\
3 &  \ \ \tau_{2}^{(i)} <  y^*_i < \tau_3^{(i)} \\
\vdots &  \hphantom{\tau_{1}^{(i)} \leq \ \ \ } \vdots \\
m_i & \tau_{m_i-1}^{(i)} < y^*_i < \tau_{m_i}^{(i)},
\end{cases}
\] with the \emph{thresholds} \(\tau_k^{(i)}\) for item \(i\) satisfying
the ordering \[
-\infty \equiv \tau_0^{(i)} < \tau_1^{(i)} < \tau_2^{(i)} < \cdots < \tau_{m_i-1}^{(i)} < \tau_m^{(i)} \equiv +\infty.
\] Evidently, the model is invariant to a linear transformation, since
scaling and shifting the underlying variables \(y_i^*\) do not affect
the outcome of the ordinal variable \(y_i\). For this reason it is
convenient to assume, for the purposes of model identifiability, a zero
mean Gaussian distribution \(\by^* \sim \N_p(\bzero,\bSigma_{\by^*})\),
where \(\bSigma_{\by^*}\) is a correlation matrix.

The underlying continuous variables \(\by^*\), unlike their discrete
counterparts \(\by\), are now suitable to be modelled using a factor
analysis model. Here, the goal is to find a set of latent factors
\(\bfeta = (\eta_1,\dots,\eta_q)^\top \in \bbR^q\), with \(q \ll p\),
that sufficiently explain the covariance structure of the
\(p\)-dimensional variable space. This is achieved by the relationship
\[
\by^* = \bLambda \bfeta + \bepsilon,
\] where \(\bLambda\) is a (often sparse) \(p \times q\) matrix of
factor loadings, and \(\bepsilon\) is a vector of residuals. Certain
distributional assumptions are made, namely that
\(\bfeta \sim \N_q(\bzero,\bPsi)\) with \(\bPsi\) a correlation matrix,
\(\bepsilon \sim \N_p(\bzero,\bTheta_{\bepsilon})\) with
\(\bTheta_{\bepsilon} = \bI - \diag(\bLambda \bPsi \bLambda^\top)\), and
that \(\Cov(\bfeta,\bepsilon) = \bzero\). Together, this implies that
the polychoric correlation matrix of \(\by\) is given by \[
\bSigma_{\by^*} = \bLambda \bPsi \bLambda^\top + \bTheta_{\bepsilon} \in \bbR^{p\times p}.
\] As a remark, the UV approach is commonly employed in the context of
confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) models due to the ease of modelling,
though other approaches such as item response theory (IRT) models are
also available (Jöreskog \& Moustaki, 2001).

For this factor analysis model, the parameters of interest are the
non-zero entries \(\blambda\) of the loading matrix \(\bLambda\), the
unique non-diagonal entries \(\bpsi\) in the factor correlation matrix
\(\bPsi\), and the thresholds
\(\btau^{(i)} = (\tau_1^{(i)},\dots,\tau_{m_i-1}^{(i)})^\top\) for each
ordinal item \(y_i\). Collectively, these parameters are denoted by
\(\theta = (\blambda^\top,\brho^\top,\btau^{(1)},\dots,\btau^{(p)})^\top\)
belonging to some parameter space \(\Theta\). Under this CFA model, each
joint response probability \(\pi_r\) from
Equation~\ref{eq-each-joint-resp-prob} is now evaluated as a function of
\(\theta\):
\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-joint-resp-prob-integral}{
\pi_r := \pi_r(\theta) = \idotsint \limits_{\mathcal C_r} \phi_p(\by^* \mid \bzero,\bSigma_{\by^*}) \, \dint\by^*,
}\end{equation} where the \(p\)-dimensional integral is taken over the
set
\(\mathcal C_r = \{ \by^* \in \bbR^p \mid y_i = \mathbf c_{ri}, i=1,\dots,p\}\),
the set of all continuous values that yield the response pattern
\(\mathbf c_r\).

\subsection{Parameter estimation}\label{parameter-estimation}

Suppose that a sample \(\mathcal Y = \{\by^{(s)}\}_{s=1}^n\) is
obtained, where \(\by^{(s)} = (y_1^{(s)},\ldots,y_p^{(s)})^\top\)
represents the \(p\)-dimensional ordinal-data observation from subject
\(s\in\{1,\dots,n\}\). As a remark, samples may not necessarily be
independent, and in such cases, corresponding sampling weights
\(\omega_s\) can be used to account for the sampling design (Jamil et
al., 2025), and most of what will be discussed below can be adapted to
account for this.

Many methods exist to estimate the parameters \(\theta\) of the CFA
model, but we are most interested in those that yield a
\(\sqrt{n}\)-consistent and asymptotically normal estimator.
Specifically, we assume that \(\hat\theta\) satisfies
\begin{equation}\phantomsection\label{eq-theta-consistent}{
\sqrt{n}(\hat\theta - \theta) = \bQ_n \cdot \sqrt{n}(\bp - \bpi(\theta)) + o_p(1),
}\end{equation} where the term \(\bp = (\pi_1,\ldots,\pi_R)^\top\) is
the vector of empirical joint response proportions, and \(\bQ_n\) is
some \emph{influence matrix} that performs asymptotic linearisation from
the joint response proportions \(\bp\) to the parameters \(\theta\).
This includes a wide range of likelihood and pseudo-likelihood based
methods and also generalised least squares (GLS) based methods, with the
latter popularly implemented as a 3-stage procedure in software. The
result also holds true whether full information methods (i.e.,
estimation using joint response probabilities) or limited information
methods (i.e., using a lower-order subset of the response probabilities)
are employed.

A neat way of viewing the parameter estimation is that most of these
methods are a class of M-estimators. M-estimation provides a general and
flexible framework for parameter estimation, in which estimators are
obtained by minimizing an objective function \(F(\theta)\), typically
expressed as an empirical average \(\sum_{i=1}^n F(Y_i, \theta)\), or,
equivalently, by solving a system of estimating equations
\(\sum_{i=1}^n \nabla_\theta F(Y_i, \theta) = \bzero\), where
\(\nabla_\theta F = \partial F / \partial \theta\). This formulation
encompasses a wide range of classical and robust procedures, including
maximum likelihood, least squares, and weighted least squares methods
mentioned above.

In the context of confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) with ordinal
indicators, the estimating equations typically arise from a discrepancy
function defined on thresholds and polychoric correlations, and
M-estimation offers a principled way to derive estimators even when the
full likelihood is computationally intractable. A central assumption in
this framework is that there exists a parameter \(\theta_0 \in \Theta\)
such that the population moment condition
\(\E[\nabla_\theta F(Y, \theta_0)] = 0\) holds. This condition is not a
consequence of the data, but rather a theoretical premise about the
underlying data-generating mechanism. It defines the parameter value to
which the estimator is expected to converge. In a correctly specified
model, \(\theta_0\) corresponds to the true parameter; in the presence
of misspecification, it instead represents the value that best satisfies
the moment condition within the assumed model class.

Under standard regularity conditions---such as continuity of
\(\nabla_\theta F\) in \(\theta\), measurability, and uniform
convergence of empirical averages---the M-estimator \(\hat\theta\) is
consistent and asymptotically normal (Huber, 1964; van der Vaart, 1998).
Specifically, \[
\sqrt{n}(\hat\theta - \theta_0) \xrightarrow{\text D} \N(\bzero, \bV),
\] where the asymptotic variance is given by the sandwich formula
\(\bV = H^{-1} J H^{-T}\), with \[
\bH = \E \left[ - \nabla_\theta^2 F(Y,\theta) \right], \quad
\bJ = \E \left[ \nabla_\theta F(Y,\theta) \nabla_\theta F(Y,\theta) ^\top \right].
\] These properties make M-estimation particularly appealing in settings
where the data are ordinal and the working model may be misspecified, as
is often the case in large-scale psychometric applications. For a
detailed treatment of the asymptotic theory of M-estimators in

For the commonly used techniques to estimate CFA, the table below gives
an overview for the form that \(F\) and its derivatives take.

Achieving the desired form stated in Equation~\ref{eq-theta-consistent}
requires an asymptotic linearisation argument. For CFA models, a general
M-estimator \(\hat\theta\) for \(\theta\) is obtained by solving the set
of estimating equations \[
U(\theta) := n \bDelta(\theta)^\top \bW_{\theta} (\bmm - \mu(\theta)) = 0
\]\\
where \(\bmm\) is a vector of sample ``moments'', \(\mu(\theta)\) is the
vector of model-implied moments, \(\bDelta(\theta)\) is the Jacobian of
the model-implied moments with respect to \(\theta\), and
\(\bW_{\theta}\) is a weight matrix which may or may not depend on the
parameters. Under correct model specification, the sensitivity matrix
takes the form \[
\bH(\theta) = \bDelta(\theta)^{\top} \bW_{\theta}  \bDelta(\theta).
\] A first-order Taylor expansion of \(U_n(\theta)\) around \(\theta\)
and with a little rearranging and multiplying through by \(\sqrt n\)
gives\\
\[
\sqrt{n}\,(\hat\theta - \theta)
=
\left[ - \frac{1}{n} \frac{\partial U(\theta)}{\partial\theta} \right]^{-1}
\bDelta(\theta)^\top \bW_{\theta} \cdot \sqrt n (\bmm - \mu(\theta))
+ o_p(1),
\] where the observed Hessian
\(-\frac{1}{n}\partial U(\theta) / \partial\theta \xrightarrow{\text P} \bH(\theta)\)
as \(n \to \infty\). Taking limits, we now see the influence matrix for
CFA taking the form \[
\tilde \bQ_n = \left[ - \frac{1}{n} \frac{\partial U(\theta)}{\partial\theta} \right]^{-1}
\bDelta(\theta)^\top \bW_{\theta} \xrightarrow{\text P} \bH(\theta)^{-1} \bDelta(\theta)^\top \bW_{\theta} \quad \text{ as } n\to\infty.
\]

For certain estimators like maximum likelihood, the influence matrix
directly fits in with the \(R\)-vector of moment differences
\(\bmm - \mu(\theta) = \bp - \bpi(\theta)\). Incidentally, in this case,
the influence matrix is
\(\cI^{-1} \bDelta_\pi \bD_\pi \in \bbR^{t \times R}\), where
\(\cI= \bDelta^\top \bD^{-1} \bDelta^\top\) is the unit Fisher
information, \(\bDelta_\pi= (\partial \bpi / \partial \theta)^\top\) is
the Jacobian of the joint response probabilities with respect to the
parameters, and \(\bD_\pi = \diag(\bpi)\) is a diagonal matrix of the
joint response probabilities, agreeing with results in Maydeu-Olivares
\& Joe (2005). It can be further shown that \(\E[\tilde\bQ_n]\)
simplifies to \(\bDelta_\pi^\top \cI^{-1} \bDelta_\pi\).

In other cases, we need to post multiply the influence matrix
\(\tilde\bQ_n\) by an appropriate matrix so that it fits into the
matrix-vector multiplication. This depends on the vector of moment
differences. When dealing with pairwise likelihood, then an appropriate
design matrix must be constructed to extract the pairwise probabilities
from the joint response probabilities (Jamil et al., 2025). When dealing
with lower-order moments such as uni- and bi-variate moments, a similar
thing is done. These represent cases where there is a linear
relationship \(g\) going from the moments \(\bmm\) and \(\bmu\) to the
response probabilities \(\bp\) and \(\bpi\). In cases where the
transformation \(g: \bp \mapsto \bmm\) is not linear, such as the
commonly used WLS methods, then we appeal to the Delta method. In the
DWLS case, the transformation is \[
g: \bp \mapsto (\bs_1, \bs_2)^\top
\] where \(\bs_1\) are thresholds and \(\bs_2\) are the polychoric
correlations. Such a transformation was described by Muthén (1978) in
the context of dichotomous data, but extends to the case of ordinal data
too. Let \(\bG := \partial g / \partial \bp\) be the Jacobian of the
transformation. Then, \[
\begin{aligned}
\sqrt n (\bmm - \bmu(\theta)) 
&= \sqrt n \big(g(\bp) - g(\bpi(\theta))\big) \\
&= \bG \sqrt n \big(\bp - \bpi(\theta)\big) + o_p(1).
\end{aligned}
\] Plugging this into the above equation lets us see the form of the
influence matrix as \(\bQ_n = \tilde\bQ_n \bG\).
