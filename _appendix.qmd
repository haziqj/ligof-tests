## Derivatives

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial \ell(\theta)}{\partial \theta} 
&= \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta} \left( \sum_{i=1}^{n} \log p(x_i | \theta) \right)\\
&= \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta} \log p(x_i | \theta) \\
&= \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{1}{p(x_i | \theta)} \frac{\partial p(x_i | \theta)}{\partial \theta}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Additional proof

Please look at @thm-prime.

::: {#thm-prime}
There are an in finite number of primes.

::: {.proof}
Assume there are a finite number of primes, say $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$.
Consider the number $N = p_1 p_2 \cdots p_n + 1$. This number is not divisible by any of the primes $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$ (since it leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by any of them). Therefore, $N$ must either be prime itself or have a prime factor that is not in our original list, contradicting the assumption that we had listed all primes. Thus, there are an infinite number of primes.
